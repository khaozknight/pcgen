# Inphidian Gauntlets
# Aura faint transmutation; CL 3rd
# Slot hands; Price 24,000; Weight1/2 lb.
# 
# DESCRIPTION
# Inphidian gauntlets are leather or metal gauntlets that provide a creature (normally an inphidian) with limbs but without humanoid hands a set of fully functional hands. When wearing these gauntlets, the creature can manipulate items normally considered unusable (because the creature lacks hands). The wearer can use its full Strength and Dexterity while wearing these gauntlets. An inphidian cannot use its hand-snake bite attacks while wearing inphidian gauntlets. These gauntlets serve no purpose to creatures with humanoid hands.  These gauntlets are manufactured by inphidian craftsmen and are virtually unknown outside the inphidian community.

# Essence Ingots
# 
# Essence ingots are small rectangular bricks of blackened stone that contain the soul of a living creature. Creatures are trapped in essence ingots through the use of a great smelter, the location of which has been lost.

# A trapped spirit can be released by casting remove curse (or similar and more powerful magic). A released soul reforms its material body in 1d4 rounds. An essence ingot has a hardness 5, hp 10, and Break DC 20. Note, however, that if an essence ingot is broken, the trapped soul is not released but is lost forever.
