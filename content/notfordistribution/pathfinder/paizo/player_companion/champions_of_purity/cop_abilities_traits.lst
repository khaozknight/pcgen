Blessed Touch	KEY:Trait ~ Blessed Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Blessed Touch],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]	DESC:You may have been raised in a devout family, studied the divine in a formal church environment, or even learned how to combine traditional healing techniques with those of divine casters. In so doing, you have focused yourself into being the perfect vessel for your deity. Divine power flows through you like a mountain stream, making your healing touch more potent than that of others. You heal 1 additional point of damage when using lay on hands, channeling energy, or casting a cure spell.	SOURCEPAGE:p.7

When using the withdraw action, both the first and second squares of your movement are not considered threatened by any opponents you can see, rather than just the first square.	SOURCEPAGE:p.11
