Align Spell-Like Ability										DESC:The creature can use a spell-like ability tuned to either law, chaos, good, or evil.																		TYPE:General		PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 4th.																											BENEFIT:Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an aligned spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability normally usable only once or twice per day). An aligned spell-like ability gains the good, evil, lawful, or chaotic descriptor.  When a creature uses an aligned spell-like ability, one-half the spell-like ability’s damage is of that type (evil, good, lawful, or chaotic). For example, a creature casts an aligned (evil) lightning bolt with a caster level of 6th. The aligned lightning bolt deals 3d6 points of unholy damage and 3d6 points of electricity damage. Thus, a creature immune to electricity suffers no damage from the electricity effect, but still takes 3d6 points of unholy damage.  Aligned spell-like abilities deal normal damage to creatures with regeneration if the creature’s description states that it takes damage from that type of effect (for instance, devils that are only harmed by good-aligned spells and effects would take damage from a good-aligned spell-like ability). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one made when a character casts dispel magic) are not affected. Spell-like abilities that already have an alignment descriptor are not affected.  The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level -1. For a summary, see the table at the end of this section. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 6th-level caster can only align spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 2nd level or lower.  Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
Crush														DESC:The creature can land on opponents and crush them under its weight.

A crush attack affects as many foes as can fit under the creature’s body. An affected creature must attempt a Reflex save (DC %4) or be pinned. If the creature wishes to continue the pin, it must make a new CMB check each round.  Pinned creatures take damage each round the hold is maintained if they do not escape.|CrushBludgeoningDice|CrushBludgeoningDieSize|CrushBludgeoningBonus|CrushDC
Enlarge Spell-Like Ability										DESC:The creature can use a spell-like ability to a range farther than normal.																			TYPE:General		PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 4th.																											BENEFIT:Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an enlarged spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability normally usable only once or twice per day).  When a creature uses an enlarged spell-like ability with a range of close, medium, or long the range increases by 100%%. An enlarged spell-like ability with a range of close now has a range of 50 ft. + 5 ft./level, while a mediumrange spell-like ability has a range of 200 ft. + 20 ft./level, and a long-range spell-like ability has a range of 800 ft. + 80 ft./level. Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one made when a character casts dispel magic) are not affected.  Spell-like abilities whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as spell-like abilities whose ranges are not close, medium, or long are not affected.  The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level –1. For a summary, see the table at the end of this section. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 6th-level caster can only enlarge spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 2nd level or lower.  Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
Extend Spell-Like Ability										DESC:The creature can use a spell-like ability that lasts longer than normal.																				TYPE:General		PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 4th.																											BENEFIT:Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an extended spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability normally usable only once or twice per day).  When a creature uses an extended spell-like ability, its duration is doubled. Spell-like abilities whose durations are instantaneous, concentration, or permanent are not affected.  The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round down) -1. For a summary, see the table at the end of this section. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 6th-level caster can only extend spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 2nd level or lower.  Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
Gaze to Ray													DESC:The creature can use its gaze attack as a ray.																								TYPE:General		PRESTAT:1,INT=13																																BENEFIT:The creature can project its gaze attack as a ray of energy to a range of 30 feet. This requires the creature to succeed at a ranged touch attack to affect an opponent. A creature hit by the ray suffers the effects just as if it had met the creature’s gaze (if the gaze allows a save, the opponent gets its save to avoid its effects).  After using this feat, the creature cannot use its gaze attack (that is, its gaze attack effectively “turns off”) for 1d4 rounds and it is disoriented during this time (–2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks).
Healing Shift												DESC:When a therianthrope shifts forms, it heals a limited amount of damage.																				TYPE:General		PRETEMPLATE:1,Therianthrope																														BENEFIT:When a therianthrope changes forms, it immediately heals a number of hit points equal to its total character level (Hit Dice plus any class levels). This does not function if the therianthrope is slain (and reverts back to its animal form). This feat is usable once per day.  Normal: Therianthropes do not regain lost hit points for changing forms.
Improved Constriction											DESC:The creature’s constriction attack is deadlier than normal.																						TYPE:General		PREMULT:2,[PREATT:4],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Constrict]																							BENEFIT:The damage for the creature’s constrict attack increases by one step, as if the creature’s size had increased by one category: 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6.
Improved Flight												DESC:The creature has more control over flying than normal.																							TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Flight Maneuverability	BONUS:VAR|Maneuverability|1																			BENEFIT: The creature’s maneuverability improves by one category: clumsy to poor; poor to average; average to good. If the creature’s maneuverability is already good, it gains no benefit from this feat.  Special: This feat can be taken more than once. Each time a creature takes this feat its maneuverability improves by one category.
Improved Poison												DESC:The creature’s poison is more potent than normal.																							TYPE:General		PREMULT:2,[PRETEXT:Ability to deliver poison from a natural attack],[PREATT:4]																					BENEFIT:The damage (hit point or ability) for the creature’s poison increases by one step using the following progression: 1, 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 2d8, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6.  Special: Poisons that do not deal damage or drain are unaffected by this feat.
Improved Scent												DESC:The creature’s scent ability is greater than normal.																							TYPE:General		PREMULT:2,[PRESTAT:1,WIS=15],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Scent]																						BENEFIT:The creature can detect opponents within 60 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 120 feet. If the opponent is downwind, the range decreases to 30 feet. This otherwise follows the rules of the scent ability (see the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). Special: Scent allows the creature to detect opponents to a range of 30 feet by smell.
Improved Spell Resistance										DESC:The creature’s ability to resist spells is more potent than normal.																				TYPE:General		PRESRGT:1	!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Spell Resistance																								BENEFIT:The creature’s spell resistance increases by +2. This feat can only be taken once.
Maximize Spell-Like Ability										DESC:The creature can use a spell-like ability to maximum effect.																						TYPE:General		PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 8th.																											BENEFIT:Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as a maximized spelllike ability three times per day (or less, if the ability normally usable only once or twice per day).  When a creature uses a maximized spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased to their maximum effect. A maximized spell-like ability deals maximum damage, cures maximum hit points, affects maximum targets, and so on as appropriate.  For example, a hellstoker devil’s burning hands deals 20 points of damage (5d4 maximized). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one made when a character casts dispel magic) are not affected. Spelllike abilities without random variables are not affected.  The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level –3. For a summary, see the table at the end of this section. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 10th-level caster can only maximize spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 2nd level or lower.  Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
Mighty Blow													DESC:The creature delivers a devastating hit that sends an opponent flying.																				TYPE:General.Combat	PREMULT:3,[PRESTAT:1,STR=25],[PRESIZEGTEQ:H],[PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Awesome Blow,Power Attack,Improved Bull Rush]															BENEFIT:For every size over Large, the creature adds 10 feet to the distance it knocks a foe backwards when using the Awesome Blow feat.  Therefore, a creature of Huge size adds +10 feet; Gargantuan, +20 feet; Colossal, +30 feet.
Native Spell-Like Ability										DESC:The creature can use a spell-like ability with greater effect when on its native plane.																	TYPE:General		PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher, any plane of origin other than the Material Plane.																BENEFIT:Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as a native spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability normally usable only once or twice per day).  When a creature uses a native spell-like ability while on its home (or native) plane, the spell-like ability has an effective caster level of one level higher. All effects dependent on the spell-like ability’s level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a lesser globe of invulnerability) are calculated according to the increased caster level.  Creatures native to the Material Plane gain no benefit from this feat.  The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level –2. For a summary, see the table at the end of this section. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 10th-level caster can only make native spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 3rd level or lower. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
Power of Evil												DESC:The creature can gain a profane bonus to its AC when on any evilaligned plane.																			TYPE:General		PREMULT:5,[PRERACE:1,TYPE=Outsider],[PREALIGN:CE,NE,LE],[PRESTAT:1,CHA=13],{PREATT:8},[PRETEXT:Must be from an evil-aligned outer plane]												BENEFIT:When on an evil-aligned outer plane, the creature can imbue itself with a portion of the plane as a full-round action. This grants it a profane bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus. The profane bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the creature’s Charisma bonus. This feat can be used three times per day. This feat can only be taken once.  For example, a pit fiend on an evil-aligned plane spends a full-round action using this feat. It gains a +8 profane bonus to its Armor Class that lasts for 8 rounds.
Power of Righteousness											DESC:The creature can gain a sacred bonus to its AC when on any goodaligned plane.																			TYPE:General		PREMULT:5,[PRERACE:1,TYPE=Outsider],[PREALIGN:CG,NG,LG],[PRESTAT:1,CHA=13],{PREATT:8},[PRETEXT:Must be from an good-aligned outer plane]												BENEFIT:When on a good-aligned outer plane, the creature can imbue itself with a portion of the plane as a full-round action. This grants it a sacred bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus. The sacred bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the creature’s Charisma bonus. This feat can be used three times per day. This feat can only be taken once.  For example, a solar on a good-aligned plane spends a full-round action using this feat. It gains a +7 sacred bonus to its Armor Class that lasts for 7 rounds.  
Quicken Shift												DESC:A therianthrope can change forms slightly faster than normal.																					TYPE:General		PREMULT:2,[PRETEMPLATE:1,Therianthrope],[PRESTAT:1,INT=13]																									BENEFIT:When a therianthrope changes forms it does so as a move action. Normal: Changing forms is a standard action.
Resistance to Negative Energy		KEY:Resistance to Negative Energy ~ First		DESC:The creature gains resistance to the effects of negative energy (such as that delivered by inflict spells, channeled energy, some undead, or exposure to negative energy creatures).		TYPE:General		!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Resistance to Negative Energy ~ First	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:NegativeEnergyResistance|0	BONUS:VAR|NegativeEnergyResistance|5									BENEFIT:The creature gains resistance %1 to any damage-dealing/healing negative energy effect.|NegativeEnergyResistance
Resistance to Negative Energy		KEY:Resistance to Negative Energy ~ Second	DESC:The creature's resistance to the effects of negative energy improves.																				TYPE:General		PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Resistance to Negative Energy ~ First],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Resistance to Negative Energy ~ Second]	VISIBLE:NO	BONUS:VAR|NegativeEnergyResistance|5
Resistance to Positive Energy		KEY:Resistance to Positive Energy ~ First		DESC:The creature gains resistance to the effects of positive energy (such as that delivered by inflict spells, channeled energy, some undead, or exposure to positive energy creatures).		TYPE:General		!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Resistance to Positive Energy ~ First	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:PositiveEnergyResistance|0	BONUS:VAR|PositiveEnergyResistance|5									BENEFIT:The creature gains resistance %1 to any damage-dealing/healing positive energy effect.|PositiveEnergyResistance
Resistance to Positive Energy		KEY:Resistance to Positive Energy ~ Second	DESC:The creature's resistance to the effects of positive energy improves.																				TYPE:General		PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Resistance to Positive Energy ~ First],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Resistance to Positive Energy ~ Second]	VISIBLE:NO	BONUS:VAR|PositiveEnergyResistance|5
Shape Breath Weapon											DESC:The creature can control the shape of its breath weapon, releasing it in a cone, line, or burst.																TYPE:General		PRETEXT:Breath weapon as a special attack.																											BENEFIT:The creature can shape the area of effect of its breath weapon as a free action whenever it uses it. If the creature’s base breath weapon is cone-shaped, it can release it in a line twice as long that deals 1-1/2 times the amount of normal damage (where applicable) to a single target due to the concentration of the effect. (Damage includes physical damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain.) Breath weapons that cause petrification, slow, haste, or replicate any spell that cannot be quantified as damage (see above) do not gain the bonus for increased damage. For example, a gorgon’s normal breath weapon is a 60-foot cone of petrifying gas. Using this feat, the same gorgon could release its breath in a line to a range of 120 feet. Since its breath weapon petrifies an opponent, it does not gain the 1-1/2 bonus to damage (as there really isn’t any physical damage dealt).  A line-shaped breath weapon can be released in a cone with a range of one-half its normal effect. The breath weapon deals half normal damage due to the effect being diluted over an area. For example, a behir’s normal breath weapon is a 20-foot line that deals 7d6 points of electricity damage. Using this feat, it could release it in a 10-foot cone that dealt 3d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures in the area.  A breath weapon can be shaped as a burst with a range of 30 feet or the normal range for the creature’s breath weapon if it was released in a line (whichever is smaller). The breath weapon travels to the range indicated or until it contacts a solid surface (whichever happens first).  Upon impacting a solid surface or reaching maximum range, the breath weapon explodes in a burst from the point of origin and covers an area as if the creature had released its breath weapon in a cone. Affected creatures in the area take damage as if the creature had released its breath weapon in a cone. For example, a behir (normal breath weapon is a line, 20 feet long, 7d6 electricity damage) could release its breath weapon as a burst with a range of 20 feet. When the breath weapon contacts a solid surface or reaches a point 20 feet away, it explodes and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to all within 10 feet of the point of origin.
Spirited Runner												DESC:The creature can turn while running.																										TYPE:General		PREMULT:2,[PRESTAT:1,DEX=15],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Endurance]																							BENEFIT:When running, the creature can turn 90° left or right. The creature slows just before, during, and after its makes the turn but can assume full speed once the turn is complete. It costs 2 squares of movement in the space before the turn, the space the creature turns in, and the space after the turn. Any movement the creature has left can be taken normally once the turn is completed. A creature can turn as many times as it wants using this feat so long as it can pay the movement cost.  For example, a leopard (base speed 40 feet) has a run speed of 160 feet (32 squares). It could move 13 squares, turn, then move 13 more squares to finish out its movement. It costs the leopard 13 squares of movement to move the first 13 squares (1 square each), then 2 squares just before, during, and after the turn (a total of 6 squares). The leopard has 13 squares of movement left in which to move after making the turn.  Special: Creatures with a swim speed can use this feat when swimming if they take a run action.  Normal: When running, the creature can normally only run in a straight line.
Swim-By Attack												DESC:The creature can move before and after it makes an attack while swimming.																			TYPE:General		PREMOVE:1,Swim=1																																BENEFIT:When swimming, the creature can take a move action and another standard action at any point during the move. The creature cannot take a second move action during a round it makes a swim-by attack.  Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a standard action either before or after its move.
Thump														DESC:The creature can stomp its foot on the ground causing it to tremble, thereby knocking creatures smaller than it prone.												TYPE:General.Combat	PREMULT:2,[PRESIZEGTEQ:H],[PRESTAT:1,STR=20]																											BENEFIT:As a standard action, the creature can stomp its foot on the ground. This causes the ground to shake and shudder, and all creatures up to one size smaller and within a 10-foot radius must make a successful Acrobatics check (DC %1) or fall prone.|10+STR
Widen Spell-Like Ability										DESC:The creature can use a spell-like ability with an increased area.																					TYPE:General		PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 8th.	BENEFIT:Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as a widened spelllike ability three times per day (or less, if the ability normally usable only once or twice per day).  When a creature uses a widened spell-like ability with a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped area, increase its area by 100%%. For example, a devil with a fireball spell-like ability (which normally produces a 20-foot spread) that is widened now fills a 40-foot-radius spread.  Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one made when a character casts dispel magic) are not affected. Spell-like abilities whose area is not a burst, emanation, line, or spread are not affected.  The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level –3. For a summary, see the table at the end of this section. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 10th-level caster can only widen spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 2nd level or lower.  Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
